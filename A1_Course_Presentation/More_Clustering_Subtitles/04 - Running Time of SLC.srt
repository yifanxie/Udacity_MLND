1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,086
So there's a couple of really nice things to be

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,715
able to say about single-link clustering. So one of them

3
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:08,319
is that it's deterministic, right? So we run the same

4
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:11,625
algorithm, and unless there's ties in the distances, it, it will

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,630
give us an answer, which is, which is nice. Doesn't

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,878
require any kind of randomized optimization. Another thing about it is

7
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:21,990
that if you're doing this process in a space where

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,390
the distances represent edge lengths of the graph then this is

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,310
actually the same as a minimum spanning tree algorithm.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,330
>> Hm.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,080
>> And another nice property is that the running

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,740
time of the algorithm is actually relatively friendly and

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,060
can be characterized so let's, let's think that through.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,710
So let's imagine we've got n points or objects

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,530
that we want to cluster. And we've got K

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,700
clusters that we want as our as our target

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,050
at the end. Which of these different running times

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,940
best characterizes the running time of single link clustering?
