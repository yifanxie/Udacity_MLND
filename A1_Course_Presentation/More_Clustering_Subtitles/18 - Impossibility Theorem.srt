1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,170
>> Charles, I lied.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:01,710
>> No!

3
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,170
>> I'm so sorry. In fact, it turns out

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,700
that there is no tweak that you could do to

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,018
these algorithms to make the trifecta, to have all

6
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:13,200
3of these properties. And, in fact, there is no clustering

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,079
algorithm. It is impossible to derive a clustering algorithm

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,540
that has these 3 properties. So this is proven by

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,460
Kleinberg, and what he showed is that, once you

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,950
define these 3 different properties,

11
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,110
richness, scale invariance, and consistency,

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,070
they are mutually contradictory in a sense. So, just like we saw

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,010
in the example that we went through in the quiz, where we tweak

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,784
the algorithm and it gets us one but it loses another, that's

15
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:39,970
a necessary property. You just can't have all these 3 hold at once.

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,470
>> That's pretty surprising coming from Kleinberg, because John is

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,490
one of the nicest people I know in machine learning and

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,260
theory, and you would think that he would have tried to

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,570
find a possibility theorem, not an impossibility theorem. I'm very disappointed.

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,210
>> See, he's got a dark

21
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,120
side, is what I'm saying. This is a striking and

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,360
maybe even upsetting result, right? It's saying that, if you

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,030
actually sit down and say, well, here's what I would

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,840
like my clustering algorithm to be, which people hadn't really

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,690
done very often, once you've bothered to go do all

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,570
that hard work of saying what matters to you and

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,370
what doesn't matter to you, it turns out you can't

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,780
have what you want. You can't always have what you want.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,160
>> But, can you get what you need?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,050
>> In this particular case,

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,277
maybe. It depends if you only need 2 of these. [LAUGH]

32
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:21,300
>> Well, so how bad is this? So, so, so, I agree, it is, it is

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,040
a at least to me, a surprising result that you can't have all 3 of them.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,620
And it's a little disappointing because you'd love

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,500
to have an algorithm that does. Because, I

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,030
think we agree, all 3 of these properties

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,900
makes sense. At least, certainly, independently they do.

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,400
>> Right.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,165
>> But just how bad is it? I mean when, when you can't have all

40
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,648
3, can you come close to having all 3? Can you have like 2.9 of them?

41
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,107
[LAUGH]

42
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,560
>> Well, you can definitely have two of

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,296
them, because that's what we did in the quiz.

44
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:43,638
>> hm.

45
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,370
>> Well, it kind of depends on what, you

46
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,235
can reinterpret some of these properties and get, and nearly

47
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,750
satisfy them. And I can point you to Kleinberg's

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,340
paper to look into that. But I think I need

49
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,454
to be done with this for now. I just

50
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:56,060
wantedto give you a flavor of the idea that, one

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,320
of the reasons that clustering is hard to pin down

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,340
is because when you pin it down, it plays dead.

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,140
>> Hm.

54
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,560
>> It's like a, it's like an opossum. When you pin it down, it actually

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,870
it turns out that it still doesn't really want to do what you

56
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,940
want it to do. But in practice, what happens is people do clustering

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,120
for lots of different reasons. And

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,890
they're willing to change their clustering, like,

59
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,040
look at what actually comes out of it, and change their notion of

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,710
clustering so that it's more consistent

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,270
with what they're trying to achieve. It's

62
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,490
not great to use in this purely automated fashion, where you just hand

63
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,850
it over to the computer and be done with it. But it's still

64
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,290
a really powerful thing to do to get to know your data better.

65
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,000
>> Okay.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,110
I accept that. I feel better now.
