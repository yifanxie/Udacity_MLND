1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,540
So let's finish this clustering process. So

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,000
what were you thinking of doing next?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,320
>> Well, D and F and B and G, we both

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,120
thought were pretty close. So let's just do D and F.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,740
>> Well, D and F doesn't matter much

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,380
anymore because they're already in the same cluster.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,230
>> Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,570
>> So what is their inter cluster distance?

9
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,130
>> It's zero.

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,860
>> Yes.

11
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,840
>> because they're in the same cluster.

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,100
That's a fine point you make there, Michael.

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,340
>> Sure.

14
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,380
>> How about B and G then? I like B and G. And what do we do next?

15
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,150
>> Well, we have two, two nice clusters. So, actually

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,280
if we were to merge the next cluster. We would

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,132
end up with, I guess b and d together. Doesn't

18
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,250
really matter because it's going to merge the last two clusters together.

19
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,850
>> Yeah. So, in particular what I was what I was

20
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,500
getting at is we don't do any emerging next because now this

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
repeat loop is done. So that's, this is what we end

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,167
up with assuming that we had started off setting K equals two.

23
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:48,917
>> Um-hm.

24
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,630
>> Then, then we're done at this point.

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,990
We have what looks like a backwards R and

26
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,240
a funny looking, actually they look like Hebrew letters to

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,850
me but that's probably not a universal perspective. So

28
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,030
just one other thing to point out quickly. So we

29
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,599
can represent the series of merges that we did

30
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,860
using a structure that's kind of like this. We merged

31
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,460
a and b first, and then we merged c and d. And then we merged, I think d and e?

32
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,940
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,960
>> Or the c, d, and e. And then we merged

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,790
e and f. And then we merged g and the, and the ab cluster. And

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,430
then that left us with the two clusters. So, this, in some sense it, we've

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,380
captured the same information about what's connected

37
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,730
with what. But this is kind of a

38
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,440
nice way of representing it, because it actually

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,690
gives us a hierarchical structure. A tree structure.

40
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,000
>> A kind of hierarchical agglomerative structure.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,710
>> And there's lots of applications where it's actually useful to have

42
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,270
that, that extra bit of information. because we can now very easily,

43
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,980
look at remember, in the beginning you

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,650
said that you could see three clusters? Well

45
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,370
you can see if you just cut this tree structure here, we get, we get the

46
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,100
three. Oh. Not quite. We almost get the

47
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,070
three clusters that you wanted. Here it looks

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,840
like f is separated from the others. It

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,410
depends which, which distances we thought were closer.

50
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,440
>> And also if you combine those two clusters again, the last two

51
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,000
clusters, then basically you, you have a true tree with a single root.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,590
>> That's right. And, and that's kind of, that summarizes

53
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,810
all the different cluster structures that you

54
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,258
can get out of single link clustering.

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,680
>> Hm, I like that. So I have a question, Michael.

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,420
>> Shoot.

57
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,700
>> Well I have two questions. The first question

58
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,690
is do you know the difference between further and farther?

59
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,740
>> I do, though. I sometimes use them interchangeably.

60
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,390
>> Yeah, it turns out interestingly enough that that definitions

61
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,840
are further and farther switch every 100 years or so

62
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,430
>> Hm

63
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,600
>> And unfortunately I was

64
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,140
born in a time period where they're switching meanings again

65
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,270
and so it drives me nuts. But in any case

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,740
for our listeners, further farther means physical distance, and further

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,990
means metaphysical or metaphorical distance. So one lives farther down the

68
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,730
road, but goes further into debt. And you should almost

69
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,890
never confuse the two, the people currently are using further

70
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,890
as if it means farther. So I have a question

71
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,660
here for you, which is you define the inter cluster distance

72
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,570
as the distance between the closest two points in the two clusters

73
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,890
>> Yep, that's what it says right here.

74
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,410
>> Yeah, as if that were an immutable fact of the

75
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,880
algorithm. Is it, or could we do something else? What would

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,740
happen if we picked average distance or distance between the farthest

77
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,000
two points as opposed to furthest two points or some other measure?

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,840
>> [LAUGH]

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,470
Well, we don't know if this is physicaly distance

80
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,890
or metaphotical distance, right? Or metaphysical distance, it's just d.

81
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,330
>> That's true.

82
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,600
>> So it's like, we'll call it forthest, with an o.

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,081
>> [LAUGH] Please don't.

84
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,920
>> The forthest point. Yes good. And

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,360
average is another one. That's true. Yeah, these

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,210
are different things you could define. I,

87
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,150
my recollection of this is, they're no longer

88
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,810
single link clustering. Single link clustering is

89
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,960
defined to be closest. But you also have

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,750
other things like average link clustering, which

91
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,370
I think is the one with the average.

92
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,560
And then there's maybe max link clustering. I forget

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,030
exactly what it's called where it does the for list.

94
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,280
>> I think I saw a talk once as I didn't

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,080
understand which had to do with median distances. And that somehow

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,230
you could prove interesting things because of it as opposed to

97
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,770
the mean, which is what I think you mean by average there.

98
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,440
>> Yeah. Average meaning mean. Yeah, I mean, generally,

99
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,770
things like median are really good if the

100
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,620
numbers on the distances don't matter, just their orderings.

101
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,550
>> Mm.

102
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,110
>> So, sometimes people dif, describe that as being

103
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,650
metric versus non-metric. Non-metric, median is usually a non-metric

104
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,430
statistic. Average is, is a metric statistic. It actually,

105
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,540
the, the details of the numbers matter a lot.

106
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,200
>> Okay. Well that all makes sense I guess the basic idea is

107
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,810
that what I was saying before that the distance was some notion of where

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,360
your domain knowledge comes in. I guess it's

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
also true that the, how you define intercluster

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,310
distance is also a kind of domain knowledge.

111
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,620
It's another parameter to the algorithm. That seem fair?

112
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,430
>> Yeah.

113
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,070
>> Okay.
