1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,440
All right. We're going to talk about another clustering method. And just

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,720
to transition from the previous one, let's, let's take a look

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,710
at this data set here. We've got seven points. A, b,

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,550
c are all close together on the left. E, f, g are

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,850
all close together on the right. And d is equidistant from,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,180
say c and e. In the k means clustering setting. If

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,410
we're looking for two clusters. What's going to happen to d? So,

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,700
one possibility is it ends up with the group on the left.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,204
Another possibility is it ends up with

10
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,780
the group on the right. Another possibility is

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,400
that, depending on what happens from the

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,460
random starting state, it might end up on

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,340
the left or the right. And then

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,420
finally, it's shared between the two clusters. because

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,010
it doesn't really belong in either of them.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,160
So it's sort of going to partly join both.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,093
>> Oh, I see. So d is exactly in the middle between c and a. Okay.

18
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,850
>> That's what I intended to draw, yeah.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,880
>> Okay, good. I think I can figure out the answer.
