1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,040
>> All right, so, so how does this work, Charles? How do you do single link

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,780
clustering? Again, assuming the distances are distances in

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,290
the plane, just because it makes it easy.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,943
>> Right. So you just keep finding the

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,138
clusters that are closest, and you defined it as

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,120
where the, the two closest points in two clusters

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,527
are what makes them, is what defines their distance.

8
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:19,893
>> Mm.

9
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,493
>> And so if I look at this, if you

10
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,452
look at, look at the big outer circle. you'll, you'll notice

11
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:27,635
that each of, you start with any one of those

12
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:29,995
points and it's always going to be closer to one of

13
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,650
its neighbors on the circle than to, say, one of

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,830
those four points in the middle of the circle. Right?

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,920
>> They're close to each other.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,910
>> They're close to each other.

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,625
>> If we start doing mergings, it, it ought

18
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,930
to look something like this, right? Where we've got,

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,250
I don't know. [SOUND] Maybe. [SOUND] But little by

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,300
little it's going to be linking these things up.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,990
>> Mm-hm. And that's the key thing there that you were drawing

22
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,970
before that the bridge between the two big circles, every point there is

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,950
always going to be closer to one of the points on the outer

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,800
circle clusters than it's ever going to be. To anything else. And so,

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,140
you're going to end up making, one big cluster,

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,170
out of the outer shell. Which is kind of weird.

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,850
>> It is a little bit weird. You get these kind of stringy

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,110
clusters because two things are close to each other if they're close anywhere.

29
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,570
>> Right.

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,390
>> So, I don't know. To my eye, the best one is

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,880
the bottom right. But it wouldn't do that because k equals 2.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,120
>> Right.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,480
>> So to my, for what's, for what's left,

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,010
I guess I like the upper right. But that's

35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,320
not what single lane clustering would do. It would actually kind of

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,680
walk around the circle and link things up. Like in the lower left.
