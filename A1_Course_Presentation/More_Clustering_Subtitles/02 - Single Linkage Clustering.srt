1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,260
Alright. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,390
>> Well I'm actually pulling out a piece of paper

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,860
>> To measure things on the screen?

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,600
>> You know, because my screen is actually flat on the ground or

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,220
flat on the table. So, it looks like e and f are closest.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,460
>> Yeah, though I think we probably should

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,670
be willing to accept ef, df, or bg.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:20,830
>> No.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,985
>> Because they're all really similar.

10
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,520
>> E and f is close, b and g is

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,830
close. But d and f is actually pretty, is clearly

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,430
farther than the rest of them. Proved by.

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,640
>> D and. Really? because it looks like an equilateral triangle to me.

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,880
>> Maybe it is, actually. I take it

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,540
all back. Yeah, actually you're right. You're right.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,080
It's the angle. Well actually d and f I think are closer than e and f.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,790
>> Alright. Good! So that yeah. So the, so the, I would

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,940
say that any of those, any of those would be fine next.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,430
>> Mm-hm. And, I think interestingly won't change the answer, in the end.

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,380
>> In the end. Yeah. So let's let's continue

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,780
with this process now that the quiz explanation is done.
