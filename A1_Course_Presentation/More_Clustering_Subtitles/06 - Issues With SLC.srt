Here's another quiz. Just to kind of practice this idea of

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,120
what singling clustering does and to think about it a little

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,800
bit more. But also to wonder with, if maybe is

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,160
it, isn't exactly what we think of when we think of

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,060
clustering. So so here's a set of points that I

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,570
drew in the upper left corner here in black. And the

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,190
question is, if we run singling clustering with K equals two.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,310
Which of these three patterns will, will we be getting out?

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,260
>> Okay, I got it.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,810
>> All

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,870
right, good, let's let's give everybody a chance to think about it.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,310
>> Okay. Go.
