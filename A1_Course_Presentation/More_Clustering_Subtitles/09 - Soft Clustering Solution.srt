1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,270
Alright. So what do you think?

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,910
>> I think the answer is, three. It sometimes

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,500
would be left and sometimes would be right, depending upon

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,340
where you randomly start. So for example if you

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,990
start with your random centers on a and b. Then

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,390
I think what'll happen is, d will end up

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,700
on the right, as that point gets dragged over towards

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,700
the weight of the right, it'll drag d with it.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,500
If you started out with both points on f and

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,240
g, then I think d would get dragged to the

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,650
left cluster as the left most cluster got dragged to the

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,960
left. I think if you started it with a and

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,700
g, then it would depend upon how you break ties. And

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,500
since I always break ties lexiographically, because I like saying

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,190
the word lexiographically, it would end up on the left. So

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,340
I think the answer has to be the third choice. But,

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,920
I'll say one thing, I wish it were the fourth choice.

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,770
>> I would like to grant this wish by talking about the

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,950
next clustering algorithm which, in particular,

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,290
does soft clustering. And, soft clustering

21
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,390
allows for the possibility that a point can be shared you know,

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm a little bit of this, I'm a little bit of that.

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,103
I'm a little bit of country, I'm a little bit of rock and roll.
