1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,738
So that's it for clustering, that's what I wanted to tell you about. Did

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:06,100
you want to help me remember what we learned? What, what did we talk about?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,400
>> So, we talked about clustering, as an idea, which is sort

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,584
of a pretty powerful one. And I guess we, we connected that

5
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:15,827
to the notion of compact description. And we talked about a bunch

6
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,501
of algorithms, and in particular we

7
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,470
talked about k-means and single-linkage clustering.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,800
>> That's right, and there was another one.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,250
>> EM.

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,290
>> Yes.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,292
>> And the big difference between

12
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:30,565
EM and the other two is that EM makes for soft clusters versus hard clusters.

13
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:33,466
>> Yeah, that's one distinction. You could also say that the difference

14
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,762
between single-link clustering and the others

15
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:38,020
is it actually terminates in polynomial time.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,785
>> Mm. Doesn't k-means terminate kind of fast?

17
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:42,940
>> I, I don't think we know, exactly. I think it

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,406
could run through a lot of different configurations before it stops.

19
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:50,765
>> So we talked about some algorithms. And then we did something rather

20
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:56,392
startling, and we showed that clustering is in some sense impossible.

21
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:59,692
>> [LAUGH] Right, which is silly because we know that it's possible, we do

22
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,813
it all the time. But we can't

23
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,764
have those particular three properties all at once.

24
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:04,822
>> Right.

25
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:08,634
>> That axiomatization is mutually contradictory.

26
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:09,767
>> Mm-hm

27
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,138
>> Yeah, I think, I think that's about it.

28
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,700
So I'm ready to move onto some other unsupervised topics.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:14,700
>>

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,640
Huh. Cool. Me too. All right, well thanks, Michael. I learned a lot.

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,490
>> Sure, yeah. I think next time

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,750
you're going to tell me about something, features.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,642
>> I'm a tell you about something. Features.

34
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:27,070
>> All right! Well, I'm looking forward to something, features.

35
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,962
>> Okay! Bye, Michael.

36
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:29,819
>> See you.
