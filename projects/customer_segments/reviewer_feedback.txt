Question 2:  What's missing in your answer to Question 2 is your interpretation of these results. Which features are relevant to identify customers' spending habits, and which might be removed from the data set? (You can discuss a single feature if you prefer.)

Improvement:  Add discussion to identify the three features thare are considered to be strong relevant to customers' spending habit



Question 3: make sure to mention if the correlations identified in the scatter matrix (one of which you had already identified from your previous investigation of the data set) confirm or deny your analysis of a feature's relevance to identify customers' spending habits.



Question 5: make sure to also discuss what each principal component might mean in terms of customer spending in general. Which type of customer would you expect to present a high (positive or negative) value for each principal component?
